# ChatDB
Created an NLP-powered query translator using Python, PyMySQL, and PyMongo to convert user input into
relational and NoSQL databases queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data efficiently. Executed the full application on AWS EC2 to mirror real-time workloads in a scalable cloud environment.
